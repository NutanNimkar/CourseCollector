# Professor Overview Website

## Project Overview
The **Professor Overview Website** is designed to help first-year engineering students make informed decisions about their courses and professors. Organized by course, this platform provides a holistic rating for professors, considering multiple factors such as the date reviews were posted and common sentiments expressed by students. Additionally, it offers an AI-powered feature that allows students to upload their course syllabus to extract key information like important dates, guidelines, and submission policies.

## Features
### 1. **Professor Ratings by Course**
- Holistic ratings that take into account:
  - Date of reviews
  - Common sentiments from student feedback
- Short summaries of what students typically say about the professor.

### 2. **AI-Powered Syllabus Summarization**
- Upload a course syllabus to:
  - Extract important dates (e.g., assignment deadlines, exam schedules).
  - Summarize submission guidelines and course policies.

### 3. **User-Friendly Interface**
- Simple and intuitive navigation for first-year students.
- Organized information by course for quick access.

## Technology Stack
